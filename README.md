# SuperBank

Simple Bank Application that shows the following.

Abstraction means hiding the unnecessary details from type consumers.
Encapsulation means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
Inheritance describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class.
Polymorphism means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.


Abstraction was used to kept many details private in each class.
Encapsulation was used  to defined classes for each of the different account types. Those classes described the behavior for that type of account.
Inheritance was used to leveraged the implementation already created in the BankAccount class to save code.
Polymorphism was used when created virtual methods that derived classes could override to create specific behavior for that account type.
